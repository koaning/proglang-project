title: "Programming Languages NER"
description: "This project attempts to detect programming languages using datasets from Stackoverflow and Reddit. The goal of the project is to make a model that could be used generally but it will specifically be used as a sentiment analysis exercise on reddit. We'd like to investigate how the different communities think about different programming languages."
# Variables can be referenced across the project.yml using ${vars.var_name}
vars:
  config: "config.cfg"

# These are the directories that the project needs. The project CLI will make
# sure that they always exist.
directories: ["assets", "training", "configs", "scripts", "corpus", "packages"]

# Assets that should be downloaded or available in the directory. We're shipping
# them with the project, so they won't have to be downloaded. But the
# 'project assets' command still lets you verify that the checksums match.

# Workflows are sequences of commands (see below) executed in order. You can
# run them via "spacy project run [workflow]". If a commands's inputs/outputs
# haven't changed, it won't be re-run.
workflows:
  all:
    - preprocess
    - patternmod
    - train
    - evaluate

# Project commands, specified in a style similar to CI config files (e.g. Azure
# pipelines). The name is the command name that lets you trigger the command
# via "spacy project run [command] [path]". The help message is optional and
# shown when executing "spacy project run [optional command] [path] --help".
